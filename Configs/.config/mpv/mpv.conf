## General Settings
profile=gpu-hq                # High-quality GPU profile with optimized defaults
hwdec=auto                    # Automatic hardware decoding for lower CPU usage

## Video Settings
scale=ewa_lanczossharp        # High-quality scaling for better upscaling
cscale=ewa_lanczossharp       # High-quality chroma scaling
dscale=mitchell               # Balanced downscaling algorithm
scale-antiring=0.7            # Reduce ringing artifacts without performance hit
cscale-antiring=0.7           # Anti-ringing filter for chroma scaling

## Temporal Smoothing
tscale=oversample             # Smoother temporal scaling without heavy performance cost
video-sync=display-resample   # Smooth playback by syncing to display refresh rate

## Debanding and Enhancements
deband=yes                    # Enable debanding for cleaner gradients
deband-iterations=2           # Two iterations for debanding (good balance)
deband-threshold=32           # Adjust deband sensitivity to maintain detail

## Audio Settings
audio-file-auto=fuzzy         # Automatically load external audio files if present
audio-channels=stereo         # Force stereo output to prevent upmixing and ensure stable performance
af=lavfi=[bass=g=3,treble=g=2]  # Moderate bass and treble boost for richer sound

## Performance and Stability
# Buffering and Cache Settings
demuxer-max-bytes=300MiB      # Larger buffer size for smoother playback
demuxer-readahead-secs=20     # Read ahead to avoid stuttering on large files
cache=yes                     # Enable caching to avoid disk IO bottlenecks
cache-secs=10                 # Buffer size in seconds for local files

# Threading and Resource Management
opengl-pbo=yes                # Use Pixel Buffer Objects for efficient GPU data transfer
vd-lavc-threads=4             # Limit to 4 threads for decoding to avoid CPU saturation
target-prim=bt.709            # Use Rec. 709 for accurate color representation
hdr-compute-peak=no           # Disable HDR peak detection to avoid performance overhead

## GPU and Renderer Settings
gpu-api=vulkan                # Use Vulkan for better performance on AMD GPUs
gpu-context=x11egl            # EGL context for smoother playback on Linux
spirv-compiler=auto           # Use the best available shader compiler

# Window and Display
fullscreen=yes                # Start in fullscreen mode
fs-screen=0                   # Use the primary display for fullscreen
geometry=100%:100%            # Default window size to cover the entire screen

## Screenshot and Logging
screenshot-directory=~/Videos/mpv-screenshots  # Save screenshots in a dedicated folder
log-file=~/Videos/mpv-logs/mpv.log            # Log file to track performance and issues
